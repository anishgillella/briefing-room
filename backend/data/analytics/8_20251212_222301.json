  "overall_synthesis": "David Catalano's interview performance was extremely brief and lacked substantive detail. While he confirmed having sales experience, his answers were minimal and did not provide any insight into his skills, experience, or suitability for the role. The lack of elaboration on basic questions is a significant concern, suggesting either a lack of preparation, engagement, or communication skills. Based on this limited interaction, there is insufficient evidence to recommend him for hire.",
