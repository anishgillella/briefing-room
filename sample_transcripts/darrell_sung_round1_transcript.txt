INTERVIEWER: Hi Darrell, thanks for joining us today. I'm Sarah, Head of Sales here. How are you doing?

DARRELL: Hi Sarah, I'm doing great, thanks for having me. I'm really excited about this opportunity.

INTERVIEWER: Wonderful. So let's start with the basics. Can you walk me through your background and what led you to apply for this role?

DARRELL: Absolutely. I've spent the last six years in sales, primarily focused on financial data and technology solutions. Most recently, I've been a Senior Account Executive at Sensor Tower for about two years, where I've been selling to financial institutions. Before that, I was at Daloopa for about a year, and Visible Alpha for two years. I also had a stint at IBM early in my career where I worked across a few different teams.

What really drew me to this role is the combination of AI technology and the financial services focus. My entire career has been selling to CFOs, controllers, and finance teams, so the ICP alignment is strong. And honestly, I'm at a point where I want to be part of building something from the ground up rather than being a small cog in a large machine.

INTERVIEWER: That's great context. You mentioned selling to CFOs and controllers - can you tell me more about that experience?

DARRELL: Sure. At Visible Alpha, I was selling financial consensus data to buy-side firms - hedge funds, asset managers, that sort of thing. My primary contacts were the research heads and portfolio managers, but the budget sign-off always came from the CFO or COO. So I learned early on how to navigate those conversations around ROI, budget cycles, and procurement processes.

At Daloopa, it was similar - we were selling AI-powered financial data extraction to investment banks and research teams. The CFO wasn't always the end user, but they were almost always involved in the buying decision, especially for enterprise deals.

INTERVIEWER: Interesting. Now, I noticed you've had a few shorter tenures - about 1-2 years at each company. Can you help me understand that pattern?

DARRELL: That's a fair question, and I appreciate you asking directly. The honest answer is a mix of factors. At Daloopa, the company went through a significant pivot and downsized the sales team - I was unfortunately part of that. At IBM, I actually moved between teams intentionally to get broader experience, which shows up as multiple short roles but was really one continuous journey there.

At Sensor Tower, I've been there two years now, and the reason I'm looking is that I've hit a ceiling. The product is great, but the company is very established, and there's limited upward mobility. I'm looking for a place where I can grow with the company, not just within a role.

INTERVIEWER: That makes sense. Let's talk about your sales process. Walk me through how you typically approach a new prospect.

DARRELL: I'm very methodical about it. I start with research - understanding the company, their recent news, any triggers that might indicate a need. For financial services clients, I look at things like regulatory changes, M&A activity, or leadership changes.

Then I personalize my outreach. I'm not a fan of generic templates. I'll reference something specific about their situation and tie it to a business outcome we can deliver.

Once I get a meeting, I lead with discovery. I want to understand their current state, what's working, what's not, and what their priorities are for the next 12-18 months. I find that financial leaders appreciate when you don't just pitch - they want to be heard first.

From there, it's about building a business case, navigating the buying committee, and managing the timeline. I've closed deals ranging from $50K to $400K annual contract value, with sales cycles anywhere from 6 weeks to 6 months depending on the complexity.

INTERVIEWER: What's been your quota attainment like?

DARRELL: At Sensor Tower, I've been at 95% of quota in year one and 112% in year two. At Visible Alpha, I was consistently above 100% - I think I finished at 108% my last full year there. Daloopa was trickier because the quotas kept changing with the pivot, but I was tracking well before the layoffs.

INTERVIEWER: Good numbers. Now, this is a startup - we're small, scrappy, and things change fast. You've been at larger, more established companies. What makes you think you'd thrive in our environment?

DARRELL: It's actually what I'm looking for. I've been in enterprise sales at bigger companies, and while I've learned a lot, I miss the energy of building something. Early in my career at IBM, I was part of a newer division that felt more startup-like, and that's when I was most energized.

I also know that startup life means wearing multiple hats. I'm comfortable doing my own prospecting, building my own sequences, even helping with product feedback. I don't need a team of SDRs and marketing to be successful - though it's nice when you have it.

INTERVIEWER: What questions do you have for me about the role or the company?

DARRELL: A few things. First, can you tell me more about the current sales process? Is it mostly inbound or outbound at this stage?

INTERVIEWER: Right now it's about 60% inbound from product-led growth and 40% outbound. We're looking for someone who can do both.

DARRELL: That's helpful. And what does the typical deal size look like? And who's the primary buyer?

INTERVIEWER: Deal sizes range from $30K to $150K ACV. Primary buyer is usually the VP of Finance or CFO at mid-market companies, sometimes the Controller at larger enterprises.

DARRELL: Perfect, that aligns well with my experience. Last question - what does success look like in the first 90 days for this role?

INTERVIEWER: Great question. We'd want you to have fully ramped on the product, have a pipeline of at least 3-4x your quota, and ideally have closed or be close to closing your first deal. We move fast here.

DARRELL: I appreciate that clarity. That sounds very achievable to me.

INTERVIEWER: Wonderful. Well, Darrell, I enjoyed our conversation. We'll be in touch soon about next steps.

DARRELL: Thanks so much, Sarah. I really enjoyed learning more about the company, and I'm excited about the possibility of joining the team.
